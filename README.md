# LibraryManagementSystem
## About:
This project implements a basic CRUD application for a Library Management System using Java SpringBoot with MySql database. The application allows users to manage library books.

### Requirements:
* [JDK 17](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.
Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:
shell
mvn spring-boot:run
